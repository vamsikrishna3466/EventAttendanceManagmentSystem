SAMYAK is the biggest techno-management fete
in all of Andhra Pradesh, which sees a confluence
of students from all over the nation. This provides
an avid opportunity for students to show their
technical and cultural expertise and a platform
to learn through practice. Filled with colours,
painting the skies with fun and frolic, this two-day
fest drives home lessons of social responsibility
apart from technical knowledge. One can witness
the sun rise beautified with technical workshops
setting away with awe and exuberance silencing
after cultural extravaganza.
