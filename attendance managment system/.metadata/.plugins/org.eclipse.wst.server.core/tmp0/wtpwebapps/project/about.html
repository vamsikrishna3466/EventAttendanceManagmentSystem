<p>The Koneru Lakshmaiah Charities was established as a trust in the year 1980 with its official address at Museum road, Vijayawada and started KL College of Engineering in the Academic year 1980-81. 
The trust was converted into a Society by the name Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation in the year 1996. The K L College of Engineering has attained autonomous status in the year 2006 and in February 2009, the Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation Society was recognized as Deemed to be University.
K L University is situated in a spacious 50-acre campus on the banks of Buckingham Canal of river Krishna, eight kilometers from Vijayawada city. 
Built within a rural setting of lush green fields, the institute is a virtual paradise of pristine nature and idyllic beauty.</p>
<p> The campus has been aptly named "Green Fields" and the splendid avenue of trees and gardens bear testimony to the importance of ecology and environment. 
The campus ambience is most befitting for scholastic pursuits.
K.L. University (KLU) is one of the premier institutes in the country offering graduate and post-graduate programs in engineering. Our university is backed by excellent R&D. All UG programs of the institution are accredited by National Board of Accreditation (NBA) of AICTE - 6 of them for 5 years-the only private engineering institution in Andhra Pradesh to get 6 branches accredited for 5 years.
